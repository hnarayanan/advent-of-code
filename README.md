# Experiments With Advent of Code

I have seen [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) pop up on
social media over the last years, but never dug too deeply into it. (I
think it is the colour scheme of the site that made me assume it‘s
something too fringe and not for me.) Anyway, I was prompted to
revisit this as I am trying to learn some new programming languages.
And it‘s so fun!

Here are some of my experiments with it.



This is not really meant for general consumption. But if you‘re truly
interested, you can navigate into a given year and date, e.g.
`2020-elisp/1/` and run `make`. It will spit out the solutions to that
day‘s puzzle.

Notice I am naming folders with a `year-language`, to keep track of
what I am trying to learn.
